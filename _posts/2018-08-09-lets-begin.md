I have a couple of reasons for creating this site.

Whenever I have even a suggestion of an idea in my mind, I start a project
based on it, with lots of promise and enthusiasm. Every time I think to myself,
"_this time_, I won't stop until it's done". But soon after, in a matter of
days usually, I run out of steam, or I find a little problem in the tools I'm
using and decide to write my own, and inevitably fall to a position where I
feel that it's impossible to continue. I give up.

The most recent example of this, would be my most recent attempt (of many) to
make a game. I'm very much not fond of "slow" games, and in some kind of
zealotry always dismiss user-friendly engines like Unity, because I know that I
could make a game run faster using an engine like SDL. Then I find out that
[SDL isn't the most efficient at drawing text to the screen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29064904/how-to-render-fonts-and-text-with-sdl2-efficiently).
Before I know it, I'm sitting in front of 300 lines of OpenGL library calls and
can't even get a triangle on the screen.

I know I always make things hard for myself: in the tradeoff between _something
perfect_ and _something finished_, I always pick the former option. It happens
every time, and I see it happening, this endless loop of idea to bikeshed to
giving up, yet I let it happen all the same.

Hopefully, writing to somewhere public such as this will inspire me to _just get
things done_, so I have something to write about at the end of the day.

The other reason for my creating this site was that I've realised that I can
write quite a lot, quite fast. I thought that my writing speed would be slow
since I'm quite slow at writing code, and can't touch-type, but apparently I'm
pretty decent at reaching high word counts in little time. Hopefully, that means
adding to this site won't take up very much of my time.

I guess a final reason that I'm planning on posting stuff is that what I write
might help you guys! You never know, it might happen.
