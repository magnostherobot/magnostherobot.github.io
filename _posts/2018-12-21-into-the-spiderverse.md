There's three main reasons the parallel universe theme is important to
Spiderverse's story:

1. It's where the spider that bites Miles is explained.
2. It's where the other Spiderman variants come from.
3. It drives the plot of the main villain.

So I guess I'll go through each of these and explain why the theme isn't
actually all that important.

# The Spider

It's never made explicit that the spider that bites Miles is from a parallel
universe, but I think it's safe to say it's got something to do with the
ongoing collider tests we see soon after. The thing is, this spider could have
come from _any_ madcap experiment - time travel, biological experiments, an
attempt to recreate what made Spiderman 1 - anything! My point is, it's not
important that the spider came from a different universe: it's just an
explanation that could be replaced by practically any other explanation.

# The Gang

Spider-noir, Spider-Peni, and Peter Porker were hardly used. I was anticipating
some real character development here, both for Miles and for these three, as
they trained him to become a great Spiderman, and had some realisations along
the way. That's what it seemed like was going to happen to me, at least: they
all seem to cover different aspects of being a solid hero, and Noir in
particular seemed like he was written specifically to fit the "hard guy who
suppresses emotions but eventually realises emotions are important" archetype.
Indeed, in the final action scene we see all three fighting in pretty unique
ways, and Noir's last few words show that he does have a soft side (just not due
to any character development, I guess).

I've seen a lot of people mention that this movie is a fresh take on superhero
movies, that breaks the mould and is a great step towards reviving the genre.
But it's not different at all: it's the same story with the same characters and
the same message - all they did was add a glitch aesthetic on top of a few
things.
